# Egg Timer Project

A desktop 'pomodoro timer' application for users to time their study sessions for better productivity


## Overview

You can choose your time intervals, themes for studying and have an alarm play when the selected timers are up. there is a live countdown and timer bar to visually track your time left. This is a personal project for me to learn electron properly, so all the code is commented to a really low level of understanding.


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS for GUI design
- JavaScript for event handling
- Electron.js for desktop application functionality

## Terminal Tips
Ctrl C to quit the Electron Process from terminal itself
npm start to start the code, per package.json's start line as noted under scripts
